```

## we need a code editor:
vs code
sublime text
atom

we use vs code

we can download node to run js code but it`s not nessary becuase we can excute js code in broswer

## to run code we need Script element
we can write in two place:

1. in head section
2. at end of body section -> best option

two reason is best:
* run code from top to bottom -> if javaScript in head may broswer become busy and page not load -> bad user experinse
* javaScript code almost code in html part

but it`s not always
sometimes must put it in head section

```html
<script>
    console.log('hello world');
</script>
```

statement is a pis of code that express an action to be carry out

at the and of each statement we have ; 

string is secuns of characters


comment start with //

comment not excute and only show others why we write this codes
